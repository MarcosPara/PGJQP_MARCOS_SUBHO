                <h3 style="font-family: arial;"> A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. For example, moo is a cow as beep is to car. These mapping get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their effects.</h3>
                <h4 style="text-decoration: cornflowerblue;"> For examples, take the language used to described a debate:</h4>
                <h5>&emsp13;    "He shot down her ideas."</h5>
                <h5>&emsp13;    "She defended her position."</h5>
                <h5>&emsp13;    "She overwhelmed his arguements"</h5>
                <h5>&emsp13;    "He had to retreat from that position."</h5>
                <h4 style="text-decoration: cornflowerblue; font-style: italic;">These are all debate-as-war metaphors. It's a zero sum game. Some wins and someone loses. The idea that both people could learn from each other just doesn't come up.</h4>
